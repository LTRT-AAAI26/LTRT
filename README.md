# LTRT
LTRT: Learnable Truncated Riesz Transform for Low-Light Enhancement and Beyond

Official PyTorch implementation of our AAAI 2026 submission.
LTRT is a novel frequency-aware plugin module designed to improve segmentation accuracy by capturing edge and directional information through a truncated Riesz transform. It can be seamlessly inserted into existing segmentation models such as UNet, ResUNet, and ResUNet++.

Highlights：
1、Plug-and-Play Design: Integrates easily into mainstream segmentation backbones.
2、Frequency-Aware Edge Enhancement: Models directional and structural cues with low overhead.
